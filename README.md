2. Clicking on the Add Meals to DB button saves all the details of a few meals in an SQLite database local to the mobile device using the Room library. The specific information saved to the SQLite database is hardcoded in the application. You can access the hardcoded data from https://dracopd.users.ecs.westminster.ac.uk/DOCUM/courses/5cosc023w/meals.txt .
